# Astral-plan
A fantasy solar system database made with user authentication so that a user can create, update, and delete a solar system, with dynamic stars, planets and moons. 

## Tool Used
For the Front-end I used the React framework and deployed it on Surge. 
Express and Sequelize was used for the backend and it was deployed on Heroku.
